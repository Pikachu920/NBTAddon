# NBTAddon

A NBT Addon that may or may not be maintained. In the event I end up abandonding this, the reflective interface
I plan to add for unsupported versions should help keep it working even in my absence. Of course, this is still
liable to breakage by Mojang's obfuscation practices however field names usually stay consistent between updates.
